# Prueba t√©cnica

## Frontend

### Technical decisions

- Nextjs + Tailwind + Vercel hosting : [site](https://nivyngrx-cehron-grpavpn.ruvasq.me/)
- Tailwind customizations based on original design
- Simple animations for Hero and 5-item gallery (not implemented)
- Responsive design for all screen sizes (unfinished)
- Favicons
- [Og Image](https://og-image.vercel.app/) for social media sharing (not implemented)

## Backend

### Technical decisions
- Reuse of the same Nextjs project for the backend
- [Next](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/example) Auth for authentication (unfinished)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch-typescript-postgres) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-nextjs-prisma-to-vercel) for database and deployment (not implemented)
- [Swagger](https://github.com/jellydn/next-swagger-doc) and JSDOC for documentation (not implemented)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) for testing (not implemented)

## Devops
- Github action for auto merge/PR and eslint (completed)
- Github action for testing (not implemented)

# Trivia
- The name of the project comes from applying rot13 to `avilatek-prueba-tecnica`
- I spent 2 hours setting up a silly Github Action to run `eslint` and auto merge a PR to main.
- I'm quite sorry for not finishing the project, I had a lot of fun with it though, next 14 is great!
